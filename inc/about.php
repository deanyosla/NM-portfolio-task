            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            I've always been a creative person, drawn to different forms of art. While I enjoy many types, I have a special love for drawing. There's something about putting pencil to paper that speaks to me deeply. Whether it's sketching a scene or doodling ideas, drawing lets me express myself in a way that feels natural and fulfilling.
<br><br>I'm also into digital painting. The way I can create artwork on a screen opens up endless possibilities. It's like painting but with technology, and it's just as exciting for me.
<br><br>Art has been a hobby of mine for as long as I can remember, and I can't imagine ever giving it up. It's a way for me to unwind, explore my imagination, and share a piece of myself with the world. No matter what life throws my way, I know I'll always find comfort and joy in the act of creating art.

            <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
            <p>
            Before enrolling in the Netmatters Scion Scheme course, my exposure to coding was limited. While I was aware of its existence, my attempts at self-education in web development were met with limited success.
<br><br>Since joining this course, however, I have experienced significant growth in my understanding and proficiency. In a relatively short period, I've surpassed my initial expectations, acquiring a breadth of knowledge and skills that have equipped me to navigate the complexities of coding with confidence.
<br><br>As I continue to progress through the course, I am eager to further expand my expertise and deepen my understanding of web development. I am committed to leveraging this opportunity to cultivate a robust foundation in coding, positioning myself for continued success in the field.
